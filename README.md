# Linked in Queens Puzzle Solver

This project is a variation of the N-Queens problem. The goal is to place queens on an 8x8 board following these rules:

- No two queens can be in the same row or column.
- No two queens can be in adjacent squares.
- Each queen must be placed in a distinct colored region, where regions are represented by numbers in the input grid.
- Unlike the classic N-Queens problem, **diagonal constraints do not apply**.

## Features
- Loads an initial puzzle grid from a screenshot, saved at screenshot.png
- Uses a **recursive backtracking algorithm** to find valid solutions.
- Ensures that each region gets exactly one queen.
- Outputs a **composite grid** where `Q` marks queen placements and other cells retain their original values.
- Displays execution time for performance analysis.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed (preferably 3.12 or later). Then, clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nyberry/queens.git
cd queens
```

Install dependencies if needed:
```sh
pip install numpy opencv-python
```

## Usage
Run the solver:

```sh
python queens.py
```

### Example Output
```
Solution:

Q 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 0 0 Q 3 1 1 1
0 0 2 2 3 Q 1 1
0 Q 4 4 3 3 3 1
0 5 5 5 6 6 Q 1
0 7 Q 5 6 6 7 1
7 7 7 5 6 7 7 Q
7 7 7 7 Q 7 1 1

## File Structure
```

â”‚â”€â”€ queens.py          # Main solver script
â”‚â”€â”€ reader.py          # Loads the puzzle grid

## Future Improvements
- Implement a **graphical interface** for screenshot copy and paste and for solution visualization.
